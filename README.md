This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks I used during my student project about Instacart.

# Instacart Basket Analysis Project
Disclaimer: Instacart is a real company, which made some of its data public, but parts of the data set were fabricated for the purpose of a Data Analytics course, provided by CareerFoundry.
## Tools used for this project:
* Python/Anaconda/Jupyter
* Microsoft Excel
## Structure of the data set
* 4 data sets were merged
* Size of the final data set: 32404859 rows, 30 columns.
More information can be found in the [project report](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1EdSB51QwcIMhntxX7V-sXzpOATIFVxMt/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=109424660740456971622&rtpof=true&sd=true).

## Objectives of the Project and Key Questions
Instacart,an online grocery store, has very good sales, but they want to uncover more information about their sales patterns. I will perform an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of the company's data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the criteria provided by the Instacart stakeholders.

The Instacart stakeholders are most interested in the variety of customers in their database along with their purchasing behaviors. They assume they can't target everyone using the same methods, and they’re considering a targeted marketing strategy. They would like to see the following questions answered:
* The sales team needs to know what the busiest days of the week and hours of the day are (i.e., the days and times with the most orders) in order to schedule ads at times when there are fewer orders.
* They also want to know whether there are particular times of the day when people spend the most money, as this might inform the type of products they advertise at these times.
* Instacart has a lot of products with different price tags. Marketing and sales want to use simpler price range groupings to help direct their efforts.
* Are there certain types of products that are more popular than others? The marketing and sales teams want to know which departments have the highest frequency of product orders.
* The marketing and sales teams are particularly interested in the different types of customers in their system and how their ordering behaviors differ. They'd like to know:
  * What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how
often do they return to Instacart)?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
  * Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
  * Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering
habits?
  * After segmenting the customer base in different customer profiles, does any interesting insights arise?
